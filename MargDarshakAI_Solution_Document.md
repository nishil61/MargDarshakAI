## Database Structure

### Safety Intervention Database (30 Interventions)

**Schema:**
```typescript
interface SafetyIntervention {
  id: string;                          // Unique identifier
  issueType: string;                   // Type of safety issue
  roadType: string;                    // Urban, rural, highway
  environmentalCondition: string;      // Weather, lighting conditions
  interventionName: string;            // Name of intervention
  description: string;                 // Detailed description
  implementation: string;              // How to implement
  effectiveness: number;               // Effectiveness percentage (0-100)
  cost: string;                        // Cost level (Low/Medium/High)
  timeframe: string;                   // Implementation timeframe
  references: string[];               // Research references (IRC)
  bestPracticeRegion: string;          // Where it works best
  constraints: string[];              // Limitations and constraints
}
```

**Sample Interventions:**
1. Speed Humps/Bumps - Reduces speeding by 20-35%
2. Rumble Strips - Prevents run-off-road crashes by 5-10%
3. Guardrails - Reduces collision severity by 30-40%
4. Street Lighting - Reduces night accidents by 15-25%
5. Pedestrian Crossings - Improves crossing safety by 40-60%
... and 25 more

## AI Integration

### API Orchestration Strategy

**Request Flow:**
```
User Query
    ↓
System Prompt Processing
    ↓
OpenRouter API Request (Primary)
    ↓ (if fails)
Groq API Request (Fallback)
    ↓ (if fails)
Error Handling & User Notification
```

### System Prompt Engineering

The system prompt is engineered to:
1. **Understand Context**: Analyze road conditions, safety issues, infrastructure needs
2. **Match Interventions**: Cross-reference with 77-intervention database
3. **Generate Recommendations**: Provide evidence-based solutions
4. **Format Output**: Present information clearly without technical jargon
5. **Maintain Compliance**: Follow Spec 1.3.4 requirements

**Key Instructions:**
- Use natural language, hide internal database IDs
- Include effectiveness percentages and cost metrics
- Provide implementation timeframes
- Consider geographic and contextual relevance
- Ask clarifying questions when needed
- Maintain professional, helpful tone

### Error Handling

**Graceful Degradation:**
1. **OpenRouter Failure**: Automatically switch to Groq
2. **Both APIs Down**: Display clear error message with retry option
3. **Invalid Query**: Provide helpful guidance for reformulation
4. **Partial Response**: Show what information is available
5. **Timeout Handling**: Configurable retry logic with exponential backoff
